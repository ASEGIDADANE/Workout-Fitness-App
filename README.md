## Project Overview
This project is a Flutter-based fitness app designed to help users track their workouts and stay motivated. The app allows users to log their fitness routines, set goals, and monitor progress. It leverages the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture for separation of concerns and uses the Provider package for state management. The app provides features such as workout tracking, progress monitoring, and personalized workout recommendations.

## Architecture

### MVVM Architecture
The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to ensure clean separation between business logic and UI components.

- **Model:** Represents the data structure and business logic related to workouts, users, and progress tracking. It handles interactions with the local database or APIs to fetch and store data.
- **View:** The UI components that display data to the user, such as workout details, progress graphs, and exercise lists. The View is responsible for rendering and responding to user interactions.
- **ViewModel:** Acts as the mediator between the Model and View. It fetches data from the Model and exposes it in a way that can be easily consumed by the View.

## UI Implementation
The UI of the app is implemented with Flutter widgets, ensuring a responsive and intuitive user experience.

- **Widgets:** All UI elements in the app are built using Flutter widgets. These include buttons, text fields, images, and custom components like workout lists and progress charts.
- **Pages:** The app is structured with multiple pages, each representing a different part of the workout experience. Pages like the workout dashboard, progress page, and workout log are built using Flutter's `StatelessWidget` or `StatefulWidget` classes.
- **State Management:** The app uses the Provider package for managing state, allowing the UI to react to changes in the underlying data. The ViewModel updates the UI state when the data changes, ensuring that the display is always in sync with the business logic.
- **Responsive Design:** The app‚Äôs layout is designed to adapt to various screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience across devices. This is achieved by using Flutter‚Äôs flexible layout widgets like `Column`, `Row`, `Expanded`, and `Container`.

## Data Flow
1. **User Interaction:** The user interacts with the UI components, such as logging a workout or viewing progress.
2. **Event Triggering:** The UI triggers an event, which is sent to the ViewModel.
3. **ViewModel Processing:** The ViewModel processes the event, performs business logic, and interacts with the Model.
4. **Data Handling:** The Model interacts with the data layer (e.g., local database, API) to fetch or update workout data.
5. **State Update:** After the data is fetched or updated, the ViewModel updates the state.
6. **State Emission:** The View listens to the updated state and refreshes the UI to reflect the changes.

## Folder Structure


- **data/models:** Contains data models, such as workouts, exercises, and progress data.
- **data/repositories:** Contains repository implementations for fetching and saving data.
- **data/data_sources:** Contains data sources, such as the local database or external APIs.
- **domain/entities:** Contains entity classes representing the core business objects, like workout sessions.
- **domain/use_cases:** Contains use case classes that implement the business logic, such as adding a workout or tracking progress.
- **presentation/view_models:** Contains ViewModel classes responsible for managing app state and business logic.
- **presentation/pages:** Contains UI pages, such as the workout dashboard, log page, and progress page.
- **presentation/widgets:** Contains reusable UI widgets, such as buttons, input fields, and charts.
- **main.dart:** Entry point of the application.

## Test Driven Development (TDD)
The app is developed following TDD principles, which involves writing tests before implementing the functionality. This ensures that the app is tested thoroughly and each feature works as expected.

- **Unit Tests:** For testing individual components like repositories, ViewModels, and data operations.
- **Widget Tests:** For testing UI components like workout forms, progress graphs, and exercise lists.
- **Integration Tests:** For testing the complete workflow, from logging workouts to viewing progress.
